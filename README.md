# CSYE2780-iHelp-MEAN-app

The goal of the project is to simulate an Unified Interactive Chat application in NodeJS that lets customers to chat with multiple
customer care representatives of renowned Ecommere companies - Amazon, Ebay, Walmart etc. The web application caters chatting with
multiple representatives in a single session, intuitive chat notifications , ability of representative to push realtime data to 
customers, persistence of chat messages.
The project helped me to gain considerable knowledge on Socket programming ; how to achieve full duplex, bi-directional communication 
between client-server. 
I have chosen MEAN stack attributing to its flexibility and simplicity over other mainstream stacks. It indeed makes your code isomorphic

Software Stack - NodeJS, ExpressJS, Socket.io, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, AngularJS
